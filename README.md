# Accelerator X Website

Public marketing site for Accelerator X — live at **https://accelerator-x.ai**

---

## What this is

A static HTML site with a lightweight Node.js build pipeline. No frameworks. No client-side
rendering. Every page is pre-built HTML served directly from the repo root via Netlify.

### Phase history

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Static landing page + design system — shipped Feb 2026
- **Phase 2 (Launch):** Content Hub, hero media library, PostHog analytics, Brevo email
  capture, Netlify Functions, SEO/JSON-LD — shipped Mar 2026
- **Phase 3 (Growth):** Lighthouse optimisation, Brevo automation sequences, autonomous
  AI agent fleet, events page, workshop sales path — _in progress_
- **v2 rebuild:** full visual + structural rebuild from design handoff — shipped as a single
  cutover 14 Jul 2026 (B10, #75). The old site is preserved at tag `v1-archive`.

## Tech stack

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| Pages | Static HTML from component templates + compiled Tailwind (CLI → committed bundle) + `assets/css/` design tokens |
| Content Hub | Markdown → static HTML via `scripts/build-hub.js` |
| Testimonials | JSON → HTML via `scripts/build-testimonials.js` |
| Hero media | Config-driven cycling via `scripts/build-hero-media.js` |
| Newsletter capture | Direct JSON POST → `netlify/functions/newsletter-subscribe.js` → Brevo list #9 + Slack `#website-leads` |
| Lead applications | Apply form POST → `netlify/functions/lead-capture.js` → Airtable CRM + Slack `#website-leads` |
| Analytics | PostHog (`assets/js/analytics.js`) — cookieless, all pages |
| Hosting | Netlify — auto-deploys from `main`; pre-built artefacts committed |

**Why no framework:** Zero framework = instantaneous loads, perfect Lighthouse baseline,
no build complexity on Netlify, and full HTML control for SEO/AEO. Deliberate choice —
see decision record below.

## Repo layout

```
index.html                  Generated homepage artifact
styles.css                  Design tokens + custom styles
assets/                     Images, icons, JS (analytics.js)

  data/                     JSON config (testimonials, hero, authors)
  hero-source/              Raw workshop photos (not committed — .gitignore)

## Local development

### Install dependencies (first time)

```bash
npm install
```

### Build everything

```bash
npm run build
```

Generates: homepage (`index.html`) from `_templates/homepage.html`, article HTML, hub index, sitemap.xml, testimonials, hero markup.

### Sync shared agent skills

```bash
npm run skills:sync
```

This repo uses a profile pointer (`.agent-skills-profile.json`) to sync skills from a canonical
skills repo into `~/.claude/skills`.

### Session protocols (safe-by-default)

```bash
npm run session-start
npm run session-start:json
npm run session-end            # plan mode (no writes)
npm run session-end:dry-run    # explicit simulation (no writes)
npm run session-end:write      # write mode with confirmation prompt
npm run session-end:write:yes  # non-interactive write mode
npm run test:session-protocols # protocol utility regression checks
```

Protocol policy/config is stored in `.session-protocol.json` (branch allowlist,
quality gate commands, managed docs, and session-end push policy).

**Operating mode toggle (one edit):** set `operatingMode` in `.session-protocol.json`.

```json
"operatingMode": "solo"
```

- `solo`: low-friction defaults for a single maintainer.
- `team`: stricter guardrails (`strictMode=true`, `build+check` required, tighter staged-path scope).

### Serve locally

```bash
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5000
```

### Process new hero images

```bash
npm run process:hero-images
# Then:
npm run build
```

## Content publishing

1. Create/edit a `.md` file in `content/articles/`
2. Ensure frontmatter has required fields (see below)
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Commit and push

### Required frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: "Article Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
author: "Andy Carroll"          # must match key in content/data/authors.json
category: "AI Strategy"         # AI Strategy | The Implementation Gap | Capability Building
type: "Dispatch"                 # Dispatch | Video | Podcast | Webinar | Case Study
excerpt: "≥100 chars for OG"    # build warns if shorter
slug: "article-slug"
bluf: "Bottom Line Up Front — 1-2 sentences"
lead_magnet_cta: "Optional CTA"
next_article_url: "/insights/articles/next-slug.html"
next_article_title: "Next Article Title"
---
```

---

## Deployment

- **Platform:** Netlify
- **Trigger:** push to `main` → auto-deploy (~30s)
- **Build command on Netlify:** none — pre-built artefacts are committed
- **Publish directory:** `.` (repo root)
- **Custom domain:** `accelerator-x.ai`

Canonical URLs for `/insights` pages are built from:
- `SITE_URL` env var (local override)
- `URL` (Netlify production) or `DEPLOY_PRIME_URL` (deploy previews)
- Fallback: `https://accelerator-x.ai`

---

## Analytics (PostHog)

Configured in `assets/js/analytics.js` — included on all pages via templates.

- API host: `https://eu.i.posthog.com`
- Behaviour analytics operating model: `docs/posthog-behavior-insights-prd.md`

---

## Email capture (Brevo)

Newsletter signups flow: direct JSON POST → `newsletter-subscribe` function → Brevo API (list #9)
+ Slack `#website-leads` notification. Netlify Forms bypassed — no 100/month limit.

Lead applications flow: apply form → direct JSON POST → `lead-capture` function → Airtable CRM
(consent-stamped) + Slack `#website-leads`.

## Engineering philosophy

This repo is a working example of how Accelerator X approaches any technical build.

The instinct when adopting AI tooling is to attack the task — give the tool a prompt,
iterate on the output, ship it. That works until it doesn't: the codebase drifts,
the agent makes a confident mistake nobody catches, the system accrues debt faster
than it accrues value.

The alternative is to think first about the system that builds the thing, not the thing
itself. What are the failure modes? Where does quality degrade silently? What would a
new agent — or a new human — need to know to work here without a briefing?

Concretely, that means:

- **Standards enforced by automation, not memory** — `scripts/check.js` runs 10 checks
  on every commit. A violation is caught locally, not in production six months later.
- **Every decision recorded at the point of decision** — `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  session logs in `.claude/sessions/`. The codebase explains itself; no verbal handoff required.
- **Session hygiene as a first-class concern** — every session starts with a structured
  brief and ends with an atomic close. The cockpit (`CLAUDE.md`) is always current.
  A cold-start agent can be productive in under a minute.
- **Leverage over effort** — a pre-commit hook that catches a broken build takes 10 minutes
  to write and saves hours across every future session. That trade is always worth making.

This is the thought and care we bring to client engagements. The repo is the proof of concept.

## AI instruction architecture

### Decision

Single-source instruction system:

- **Canonical operating doc:** `CLAUDE.md` (project state, decisions, next steps)
- **Enforced standards:** `.claude/rules/standards.md` (what `npm run check` + CI verify)
- **Session protocol:** `.claude/rules/session.md`
- **Thin pointer for other tools:** `AGENTS.md`

### Operating rule

Update `CLAUDE.md` (or the relevant `.claude/rules/` file) when workflow or policy changes;
`AGENTS.md` stays a minimal pointer.
